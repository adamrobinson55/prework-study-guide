# prework-study-guide

## This prework study guide is a website that goes over all the prework done for the full stack coding bootcamp

I created this website to demonstrate my knowledge of the prework and remind myself what was done during prework. This site consolidates information found in the modules that was divided amongst many examples. My Prework Study Guide displays raw information. I learned how to work in the command and VS Code, I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github.
